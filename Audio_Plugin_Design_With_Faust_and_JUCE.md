For this workshop, we will get our hands dirty and use the Faust compiler to generate C++ DSP objects to integrate them in a JUCE audio plug-in. We expect participants of this workshop to have a basic understanding of C++ and to be able to use a terminal. In preparation for the workshop, we need you to install the following elements on your system:

- JUCE: <https://juce.com/>
- (Optional) The Faust compiler: https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/tree/master-dev
- (Optional) Any relevant SDK depending in the kind of plug-in you want to generate with JUCE during the workshop (e.g., VST, etc.)
